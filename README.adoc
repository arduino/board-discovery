= Arduino Board Discovery (Golang)

**IMPORTANT: this repo has been archived** +
The `board-discovery` project has been superseded by the https://github.com/arduino/pluggable-discovery-protocol-handler[pluggable-discovery-protocol-handler], more directly by the https://github.com/arduino/serial-discovery[serial] and https://github.com/arduino/mdns-discovery[mdns] discovery plugins.

This package allows to discover and monitor Arduino boards connected to the network or the serial ports.

=== Getting the package
[source, bash]
----
$ go get github.com/arduino/board-discovery
----
Then import it to use it:
[source, go]
----
import "github.com/arduino/board-discovery"
----

== Discovering devices
To discover devices you must first create a new Monitor (specifying the polling interval):
[source, go]
----
monitor := discovery.New(time.Millisecond)
----
Then start, get data and stop it when you don't need it anymore:
[source, go]
----
monitor.Start()
//Get devices connected
monitor.Stop()
----
You can get connected devices (via Serial or Network ports) by using the following functions:
[source, go]
----
serialDevices := monitor.Serial()
networkDevices := monitor.Network()
----

=== The Monitor

Monitor periodically (period specified by *Interval*) checks the serial ports and the network in order to have
an updated list of Serial and Network ports.

You can subscribe to the *Events* channel to get realtime notification of what's changed.
[source, go]
----
type Monitor struct {
	Interval time.Duration
	Events   chan Event
}
----

You can `Start`, `Stop` and `Restart` a Monitor, using the specified functions.
[source, go]
----
monitor.Start() // Starts monitoring
monitor.Stop()  // Stops monitoring
monitor.Restart // Restarts the monitor (Stop, then Start)
----

To have the list of devices discovered, you can use (assuming a started monitor `m`):

 . `m.Serial()` to get the list of devices connected via serial interface.
 . `m.Network()` to get the list of devices connected via the network.

=== The device types

`SerialDevice` represents a device connected via serial port:
[source, go]
----
type SerialDevice struct {
	Port         string
	SerialNumber string
	ProductID    string
	VendorID     string 
	Serial       *serial.Info
}

type SerialDevices map[string]*SerialDevice
----

`NetworkDevice` represents a device connected via the network:
[source, go]
----
type NetworkDevice struct {
	Address string
	Info    string
	Name    string
	Port    int
}

type NetworkDevices map[string]*NetworkDevice
----
